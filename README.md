pclouds-integrate
=================

Add integration tests to your puppet runs.

* Integration tests will automatically run at the end of a puppet run.
* They will only run if the puppet run contained changes.
* .. or failed last time.
* Cucumber tests will be support first but other providers could be added
  (such as server spec tests)
